DE BG6HVQ VY73!

一个普通路过的业余ham

An ordinary Chinese college student passing by (for now)

Communication is fun, and I met many interesting friends, including Ham who shared the same interests offline and those who connected through radio waves.

Explore the world through a small screen, and hope to meet more Ham friends in the future.

目前在大学内和朋友们一起玩，当前是A，预计考B证后主要活跃在短波和本地中继

Finally, I wish you a happy day and best wishes for our meeting! VY73AGN!

我有些别的小爱好，所以或许会在信封里塞点有意思的小玩意。同时我之前的卡片没发完，所以同时会附上一张空白的卡片，您可以在我的eQSL里看到

Oh, I forgot one more thing. Currently, Qsl cards include anime version  and photography version, so there may be an empty card included when sending. I also have some other hobbies, maybe there will be some unexpected gifts when you receive the letter.
